# Hack the GitHub Contribution Graph

This project is designed to generate fake commits on specific dates to "hack" the GitHub contribution graph. It automates multiple commits using Python and Git, making your GitHub profile contribution graph appear more active.

## How to Set Up and Run the Script

### Prerequisites
To run this script, you'll need the following:
- **Git** installed on your machine.
- **Python 3.x** installed.
- A **GitHub repository** where you have write access.
- A **branch** to push commits (default is `main`).

### Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine in desktop:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Iam4lex/contribution-graph.git
```

### Navigate to the Cloned Repository
After cloning, navigate into the repository directory:

```bash
cd Desktop
```

### Run the Script
To run the script, use the command below:
```bash
python3 github.py
```

### Push the changes:
```bash
git push origin main
```
